# node-hbs-starter

This is a sample node application to build ui with hbs templating

## Prerequisites
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Process to run the application

1. Clone the application from git
2. Navigate to the cloned git project folder and run the command `npm install`.
3. Once the packages are downloaded, run `npm start` to start the application.
4. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser to view the homepage.
5. Feel free to explore the multiple pages rendered using a single handlebar template, but with different content using the buttons on each page.
6. Have a ton of fun exploring node with HBS

> **Note** <br>
>`npm stop` can be used to stop the application and `npm restart` can be used to restart the app. App must be restarted to apply any new changes, but node packages like `gulp` can help in building your changes on the fly without restarting
